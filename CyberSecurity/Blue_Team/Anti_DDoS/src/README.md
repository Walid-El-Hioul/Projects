# `src/` Directory

The `src/` directory contains the source code for the application. It is organized into several subdirectories to structure the different components of the application:

## Subdirectories

- **`ui/`**: Contains the user interface code for the application. This includes UI components, layouts, and styles.

- **`controllers/`**: Houses the controller code, which manages user input, updates the UI, and interacts with the model.

- **`models/`**: Contains the model code, including data structures, business logic, and data access objects.

- **`utils/`**: Includes utility functions and classes that can be used throughout the application.
